If you ever find yourself building things from source for the C.H.I.P. or Pocket C.H.I.P. computer you will probably find that the version of `cmake` available on `apt` is super old and not supported. Here's how to go about building a newer version of `cmake` for the Pocket C.H.I.P. You will want to make sure your Pocket C.H.I.P. is connected to mains power. 

First, remove any version of `cmake` that you previously installed from apt:

```bash
sudo apt remove --purge --auto-remove cmake
```

Download the "Unix/Linux Source" tar.gz from [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/) (I've used the cmake-3.17.3 version) and decompress the tar somewhere:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.17.3/cmake-3.17.3.tar.gz
tar zxvf cmake-3.17.3.tar.gz
cd  cmake-3.17.3
```
Run the `bootstrap` script to get ready for the build. This takes a little while, so put the kettle on.

```bash
./bootstrap
```

If the bootstrap fails at all it will probably be because you're missing some headers or `-dev` (for example `libssl-dev`) packages for things, but the error messages should make it easy to find what you need to install.

Once that's done, you next need to set up a swapfile so that we can run the build without running out of memory:

```bash
# createan empty 1gb swap file
sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/swapfile bs=1024 count=1048576 
sudo mkswap /tmp/swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /tmp/swapfile

# create a loopback so we can enable the swapfile
sudo losetup /dev/loop0 /tmp/swapfile 
sudo swapon /dev/loop0

# check that the swapfile mounted
cat /proc/swaps

# you should see an output similar to:
Filename				Type		Size	Used	Priority
/dev/loop0                              partition	1048572	4	-1
```

And then finally build and install `cmake`. This takes a long time, so put the kettle on again...

```bash
make -j2
sudo make install
```

After that, check that it's working with:

```bash
cmake --version

# you should see an output similar to:
cmake version 3.17.3

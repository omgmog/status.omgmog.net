Adding an external microSD card slot to the Gameshell is very easy, with a flexible ribbon cable extension cable.

I'm using a "0.1m Micro SD TF Memory Card Kit Male to Female Extension Soft Flat FPC Cable" ([eBay link](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/0-1m-Micro-SD-TF-Memory-Card-Kit-Male-to-Female-Extension-Soft-Flat-FPC-Cable/233186823966)) -- it's features a 10cm long cable.

It's a bit pricey, but was the best option that came with an appropriately sized male microSD end to the cable.

It requires a little bit of _Origami_ to fold the ribbon into place, but once you've got it in place you can easily attach the microSD card slot to the back of the _Mainboard_ module with a bit of double sided tape (or some 3M tape).

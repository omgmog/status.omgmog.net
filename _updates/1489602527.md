Things I should probably add to this...

1. Style the individual status pages
2. Add an RSS/JSON feed
3. Add links to share (twitter?) a post
4. Link off to my other pages in a nice way -- perhaps like a profile
5. Some sort of way to make posting here via (web or Github GUI) easier... Chrome extension?
6. Make `./newpost` command work cross-platform
7. Encourage people to clone and create their own status feed!
8. Move the styles and things out to their own files.

Otherwise... this is pretty cool!

Heavy CRTs be damned! Well, at least it's out of the arcade now...

I'm working on my arcade project some more lately. As you can see there was some breakage -- the monitor is all intact, but the touch screen overlay took some damage when I tried to remove it.

The current task is replacing the old dark 19" CRT (that only does 640x480 at 31hz) with a flatscreen display.

I've ordered a Dell P190st (19", 1280x1024) on eBay which I'm hoping will fill at least part of the space left by the CRT. While I'm waiting for that, I can get working on the OS and software side of things...

But before that, I need to find the loose bits of glass on the rug.

I've been using Good Reads lately to track what I'm reading ([mostly sci-fi and dystopian](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64286273-max-glenister)), and this week I've been reading my first suggestion _from_ Good Reads: [Adrian Tchaikovsky's "Children of Time"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25499718-children-of-time).

So far I'm hooked. This is a great take on some common themes. As usual I can't help but thinking "This would make an awesome movie" after each chapter.

Synopsis:

> A race for survival among the stars... Humanity's last survivors escaped earth's ruins to find a new home. But when they find it, can their desperation overcome its dangers?
>
> WHO WILL INHERIT THIS NEW EARTH?
>
> The last remnants of the human race left a dying Earth, desperate to find a new home among the stars. Following in the footsteps of their ancestors, they discover the greatest treasure of the past age - a world terraformed and prepared for human life.
>
> But all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned, the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for them, pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's worst nightmare.
>
> Now two civilizations are on a collision course, both testing the boundaries of what they will do to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the true heirs of this new Earth?


Soo yeah. Worth reading.

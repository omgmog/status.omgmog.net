I've been thinking about how I could go about creating an extension to make posting easier as part of my usual workflow. Github conveniently have an API for creating files (that they use in their own GUI infact!).

https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/contents/#create-a-file

So I'll need to create an extension with a popup that lets you enter the body of your status update, and then creates a .md file at `_updates/{timestamp}.md` automatically.

Should be easy enough -- though it's not an urgent requirement as I have my handy `./newpost` shell script.

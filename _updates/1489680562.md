The "Mirror" mode in [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/) is really awesome. If you have an Android device you can use [Crystal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smithyproductions.crystal&hl=en) to mirror your Sketch design to your device.

I've been playing with this today to size-test some mobile UI design mockups, and it works really nicely!

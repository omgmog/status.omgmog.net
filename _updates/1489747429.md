I'm seeing a weird "new tab" behaviour in Chrome since the latest update (56.0.2987.110) the tab title shows "chrome://newtab" until you reload the page:

Seems to be a [known problem](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=702043) and interestingly it's probably caused by a server-side issue rather than an issue on the client-side in Chrome.
